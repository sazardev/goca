# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The following table shows which versions of Goca are currently receiving security updates:

| Version | Supported | Status           |
| ------- | --------- | ---------------- |
| 1.11.x  | Yes       | Current Release  |
| 1.10.x  | Yes       | Maintenance Mode |
| < 1.10  | No        | End of Life      |

We strongly recommend using the latest stable release to ensure you have the most recent security patches and improvements.

## Security Update Policy

- **Current Release**: Receives all security updates immediately
- **Maintenance Mode**: Receives critical security updates for 6 months after new release
- **End of Life**: No longer receives security updates

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of Goca seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us responsibly.

### How to Report

**Please DO NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities by email to:

**sazardev@gmail.com**

Include the following information in your report:

- Type of vulnerability
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the vulnerability
- Location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the vulnerability, including how an attacker might exploit it

### What to Expect

After submitting a report, you can expect:

1. **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours, we will acknowledge receipt of your report
2. **Status Updates**: We will provide regular updates on the progress of addressing the vulnerability
3. **Verification**: We will work to verify and reproduce the reported vulnerability
4. **Resolution Timeline**: 
   - Critical vulnerabilities: Patch released within 7 days
   - High severity: Patch released within 14 days
   - Medium/Low severity: Patch released within 30 days
5. **Disclosure**: We will coordinate with you on the disclosure timeline

### If Your Report is Accepted

If we confirm the vulnerability:

- We will acknowledge your contribution in the security advisory (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)
- We will work on a fix and release a security patch
- We will publish a security advisory detailing the vulnerability after the patch is released
- We will credit you for the discovery (if desired)

### If Your Report is Declined

If we determine the report is not a security vulnerability:

- We will explain why we do not consider it a vulnerability
- We may suggest alternative reporting channels if appropriate (e.g., bug reports)
- We will close the report

## Security Best Practices for Users

When using Goca, follow these security best practices:

### Generated Code Security

1. **Review Generated Code**: Always review the code generated by Goca before deploying to production
2. **Input Validation**: Ensure proper validation of user inputs in your application
3. **Dependency Management**: Keep dependencies up to date using `go mod tidy`
4. **Environment Variables**: Never hardcode sensitive information; use environment variables

### Development Environment

1. **Keep Goca Updated**: Regularly update to the latest version
2. **Verify Downloads**: Verify checksums when downloading binary releases
3. **Use Official Sources**: Only download Goca from official GitHub releases
4. **Secure Your Workspace**: Protect your development environment and generated code

### Generated Application Security

Generated applications should implement:

1. **Authentication and Authorization**: Implement proper access controls
2. **Input Sanitization**: Validate and sanitize all user inputs
3. **SQL Injection Prevention**: Use parameterized queries (already included in generated repositories)
4. **HTTPS**: Use HTTPS in production environments
5. **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting on API endpoints
6. **Logging**: Implement proper logging without exposing sensitive data

## Known Security Considerations

### Code Generation

Goca generates code based on user-provided templates and configurations. Users are responsible for:

- Validating generated code before production use
- Implementing proper security controls in their applications
- Following security best practices in their specific use cases

### Dependencies

Goca uses third-party dependencies. We:

- Regularly update dependencies to address known vulnerabilities
- Monitor security advisories for all dependencies
- Use `go mod verify` to ensure dependency integrity

## Security Disclosure Policy

When a security vulnerability is fixed:

1. We will release a patch version immediately
2. We will publish a security advisory on GitHub
3. We will update this document with any relevant information
4. We will notify users through release notes and GitHub notifications

## Scope

This security policy applies to:

- Goca CLI tool
- Generated code templates
- Documentation and examples
- Official binary releases

This policy does NOT cover:

- Third-party forks or modifications
- User-generated templates or customizations
- Applications built using Goca (user responsibility)
- Infrastructure where Goca is deployed

## Security-Related Configuration

### Safe Code Generation

Goca includes safety features to prevent common issues:

- Dry-run mode to preview changes
- File conflict detection
- Backup creation before overwriting
- Name conflict detection
- Version compatibility checks

Always use these features when modifying existing projects:

```bash
# Preview changes before generating
goca feature User --fields "name:string" --dry-run

# Create backup before overwriting
goca feature User --fields "name:string" --force --backup
```

## Questions or Concerns

If you have questions about this security policy or general security concerns (that are not vulnerabilities), you can:

- Open a GitHub issue with the `security` label for non-sensitive discussions
- Email sazardev@gmail.com for private security discussions

## Acknowledgments

We appreciate the security research community's efforts in responsibly disclosing vulnerabilities and helping to keep Goca and its users secure.

### Security Contributors

We would like to thank the following individuals for responsibly disclosing security vulnerabilities:

- (List will be updated as vulnerabilities are reported and fixed)

## Policy Updates

This security policy may be updated from time to time. Significant changes will be announced through:

- GitHub release notes
- Security advisories
- Project README
