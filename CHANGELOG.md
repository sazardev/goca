#### Safety Features
- **Dry-Run Mode** (`--dry-run`): Preview all file changes before generation
  - Shows exactly what files would be created/modified
  - Displays dependency suggestions
  - Zero risk file operations
  - Perfect for CI/CD pipelines and code reviews

- **File Conflict Detection**: Automatic detection of existing files
  - Prevents accidental overwrites by default
  - Clear error messages with resolution options
  - Integrates with `--force` and `--backup` flags

- **Name Conflict Detection**: Scans project for duplicate entities
  - Case-insensitive duplicate detection
  - Scans `internal/domain/` for existing features
  - Prevents confusion with similarly named entities

- **Backup System** (`--backup`): Automatic file backups
  - Creates timestamped backups in `.goca-backup/`
  - Works with `--force` flag for safe overwrites
  - Organized directory structure preserves original paths

- **Force Overwrite** (`--force`): Override safety protections
  - Explicitly overwrite existing files
  - Combines with `--backup` for safe updates
  - Useful for intentional feature updates

#### Dependency Management
- **Automatic go.mod Updates**: Auto-manages project dependencies
  - Runs `go get` for required dependencies
  - Executes `go mod tidy` automatically
  - Validates dependency versions

- **Version Compatibility Checking**: Go version verification

  - Suggests optional dependencies based on feature type
  - Provides installation commands
  - Explains why each dependency is useful
